Currently, the uswsusp module does not use s2ram and forces s2both to skip 
the video quirk handling it implements internally.  This is because we already
handle video quirks in 20video and 99video.  

If you would prefer to use the s2ram/s2both video quirk handling, edit 
uswsusp appropriately and delete pm/sleep.d/20video and pm/sleep.d/99video.
