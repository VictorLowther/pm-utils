Drive readahead parameters:

DRIVE_READAHEAD_AC = Number of KB to speculatively read on AC.
Defaults to 256 KB.

DRIVE_READAHEAD_BAT = Number of KB to speculatively read on battery.
Defaults to 3072 KB.

The theory here is that we trade off the number of times we spin up a drive
to read for potentially wasted cache if we end up not needing all the data we
read.
