This branch exists to make it easy to make RPM packages for testing purposes.
To use it:

1: Create a throwaway branch.
2: Merge the branches you want to test into the throwaway branch.
3: Merge the rpm branch into the throwaway branch.
4: Run make-rpm as root.
5: If all goes well, a shiny new RPM package will appear in the usual place.
6: Install the shiny, candylike package.
6: Profit!
