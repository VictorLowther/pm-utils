This branch exists to make it easy to make RPM packages for testing purposes.
To use it:

1: Create a throwaway branch.
2: Merge the branches you want to test into the throwaway branch.
3: Merge the rpm branch into the throwaway branch.
4: Run make-rpm
5: If all goes well, a shiny new ROM package will appear.  Install it.
6: Profit!
