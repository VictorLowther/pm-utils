=== pm-utils ===

What is pm-utils?

* Provides simple shell command line tools to suspend and hibernate computer
that can be used to run vendor or distro supplied scripts on suspend and resume.

Why do we need it?

* As all the main distros are re-implimenting the same thing, over and over, to
do something that's really quite trivial.
Having the common locations for stuff means that software and hardware vendors
can just install one file to do the clever stuff.

* Distros can easily add/remove functionality by installing/removing one
file into the hooks directory, for example:

- enabling and disabling standby LED's on laptop hardware 
- enabling suspend GUI's like suspend2 
- re-enabling video
- starting and stopping services that can't cope with suspending 
- re-syncing the time with ntp 
- removing and modprobing modules when needed 
- setting grub to be the default target for a hibernate-resume 
- other wacky things that need doing on specific systems
