	* pm/functions-ati:
	* pm/functions-intel:
	* pm/functions-nvidia:
	Remove these files as we've now agreed that this belongs in HAL, and
	a HAL patch is close to being accepted.

2006-04-28  Richard Hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>

	* pm/hooks/05led: Remove this file as we want the led to turn on at
	the *end* of the hooks stuff. We shouldn't have this and 95led.

	* pm/hooks/95led: rename to 95ibm_led as this is ibm specific.
	Make sure the led blinks at suspend, and turns off when we resume.
